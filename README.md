# music

This project is an application from the great complete Vue 3 course by Luis Ramires Project on Udemy.
In this project I developed a Vue app that manages musics using various utilities:

- howler
- tailwind
- firebase
- vee-validate
- internationalization with i18n
- infinite scrolling
- voue-router & vuex
- lodash

etc

## Deployed with vercel:
